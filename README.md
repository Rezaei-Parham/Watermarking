# Watermarking using SVD Factorization in Python

A project that uses linear algebra, primarily singular value decomposition (SVD), to add and extract a watermark from an image. The extraction process requires the `u`, `s`, and `v` matrices as Numpy files. This project was part of the Linear Algebra course at Sharif University in Fall 2022.

## Features
- **Add watermark to an image using SVD factorization**
- **Extract watermark from an image using the `u`, `s`, and `v` matrices**
- **Store the `u`, `s`, and `v` matrices as Numpy files for later use**

## Getting Started
To use this project, you will need to have a basic understanding of linear algebra and Python. Once you have that, follow these steps to get started:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the necessary dependencies
3. Run the code to add or extract a watermark from an image

## Dependencies
- Numpy
- OpenCV (optional, but recommended for working with images)

We welcome contributions to this project! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to open a pull request.
